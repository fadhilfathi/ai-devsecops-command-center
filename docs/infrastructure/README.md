# Infrastructure

The infrastructure workstream unifies the tenant's clusters,
namespaces, services, deployments, and supporting resources
into a single asset graph that powers the Infrastructure
Overview, Cluster / Namespace / Workload explorers, and the
inventory relationships and dependency graph endpoints.

## Architecture

The workstream is split into four services:

- **`kubernetes-service`** (port 4006) — the read-only
  inventory layer. Wraps a provider abstraction that can be
  swapped between the in-process `fixture` provider (Sprint 4) and a live `@kubernetes/client-node` adapter (Sprint 5).
- **`inventory-service`** (port 4009) — the asset catalog,
  relationship graph, and dependency graph.
- **`k8s-health-service`** (port 4007) — health scoring +
  detection rules.
- **`reporting-service`** (port 4012) — generates the
  Cluster Health, Infrastructure Risk, and Executive Summary
  reports.

## Data model

The inventory uses a three-layer abstraction:

1. **Provider** — translates the K8s API to the AICC model.
2. **InventorySnapshot** — a flat snapshot of all
   cluster-scoped resources at a moment in time.
3. **Asset / Topology** — the catalog and graph layers built
   on top of the snapshot.

The model layer lives at
`backend/models/infrastructure/`. The Zod schemas are the
single source of truth for the wire contract; the
TypeScript types in `frontend/src/types/infrastructure.ts`
mirror them.

## Asset kinds

| Kind        | Source                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| cluster     | `Cluster` model                   |
| namespace   | `Namespace` model                 |
| service     | `Service` model                   |
| deployment  | `Deployment` model                |
| statefulset | `StatefulSet` model               |
| daemonset   | `DaemonSet` model                 |
| ingress     | `Ingress` model                   |
| workload    | generic union of deployment/ss/ds |
| pod         | `Pod` model                       |

## Graph model

The graph layer exposes two views:

- **Relationship Graph** — top-down: cluster contains
  namespace, service selects workload, ingress routes_to
  service.
- **Dependency Graph** — same edges reversed: workload
  depends_on service, service depends_on ingress, etc.
  This is the orientation the topology viewer's layout
  engine reads as "up".

Per-asset `dependenciesFor(assetId)` returns the transitive
closure of the dependency subgraph rooted at the asset —
useful for blast-radius analysis.
